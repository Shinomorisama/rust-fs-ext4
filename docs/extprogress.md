# extprogress

## What we are doing

We are extending `rust-fs-ext4` so a normal ext4 removable-storage card can eventually be read and written safely from Windows through `ext4-win-driver`, then used natively by Linux and SteamOS. The intended use is a 1.5 TB microSD card shared between these systems.

The main compatibility gap is **ext4 casefold**: selected directories treat different spellings as the same name according to the filesystem's declared Unicode rules. Correct support must cover finding names, preventing equivalent duplicates, changing directory entries, maintaining directory indexes, and recovering interrupted writes. Stored filenames must retain their original bytes.

The goal is a working implementation. Documentation, unit tests, and independent Linux/e2fsprogs checks support that goal. Passing this driver's own tests alone is not enough to establish compatibility.

**Casefold writes are still deliberately blocked. This is not yet a Windows-ready release for the card.** No actual SteamOS hardware or Windows/card round trip has been qualified.

## Current checkpoint

- Repository: [Shinomorisama/rust-fs-ext4](https://github.com/Shinomorisama/rust-fs-ext4), branch `casefold-rw`.
- Latest implementation work: direct Linux index-route qualification and explicit refusal of unqualified casefold indexed insertion/index dropping, committed alongside this handoff update. Use `git log` to identify the current checkpoint.
- Previous implementation commit: `4a44d69134505fa8e7f0f2dc8226e0a5f94111dd` (shared frozen-policy hashing).
- Original baseline: `v0.8.0`, commit `204d8f6518ca5d66de07ab8e84c81501909b5d09`.
- Local validation: **783 unit tests pass; lint and CLI build pass**. All preceding baseline tests remain present and passing.
- [Last confirmed implementation CI](https://github.com/Shinomorisama/rust-fs-ext4/actions/runs/38042898383): **passed** at the directory-inheritance checkpoint. The [frozen-hashing CI](https://github.com/Shinomorisama/rust-fs-ext4/actions/runs/38098760054) was still running when this checkpoint was prepared. The current checkpoint also needs full CI and fresh Linux fixture results; inspect runs for their exact commits.
- Working tree clean at verification; the checkpoint is pushed to the fork.
- `rust-fs-core` remains at `v0.3.0` (`9e900154a7dff2a6c8f136db31def33bed9f09cc`). Neither it nor `fs-linux-test-harness` is to be modified.

## Planned stages and our position

These retain the original plan's Stage 0–7 numbering. Completed foundations cover the qualified subset, not every possible ext4 combination.

| Stage | Work | Current position |
|---|---|---|
| **0 — Establish Linux reference behavior** | Build Linux-created images, record encoding/settings, measure uncertain behavior, and validate with Linux and e2fsprogs. | Established for the current test profiles; extend the matrix when new write behavior needs qualification. |
| **1 — Recognize and validate casefold policy** | Read filesystem encoding and directory flags; reject unknown or inconsistent settings. | Implemented. Write restrictions remain in place. |
| **2 — Implement frozen Unicode comparison** | Use filesystem-compatible Unicode 12.1 rules, including normalization and full case folding, rather than current platform Unicode tables. | Implemented for the supported valid-UTF-8 subset. Malformed casefold names and normalized dot aliases remain refused. |
| **3 — Resolve names and retain actual entries** | Share comparison rules across lookup and mutation planning; return stored spelling and inode identity. Validate indexed lookup. | Implemented for supported read shapes, including linear directories and indexes with one intermediate level. Casefold indexed reads scan validated referenced leaves; this does not establish correct write routing. |
| **4 — Implement namespace mutations** | Make create, mkdir, links, symlinks, unlink, rmdir, and rename obey casefold identity and inheritance. Preserve transaction safety. | **Current stage: partially implemented.** Removal and rename retain/recheck matched entries. Duplicate checks use shared comparison. New-directory inode construction now inherits casefold correctly. Actual casefold writes remain blocked. |
| **5 — Implement and qualify directory-index writes** | Use frozen Unicode keys for hashing, insertion, collisions, leaf splits, and growth. Preserve Linux-visible routing. | **Hashing foundation and sampled Linux routing checks implemented.** Both index depths pass direct selected-leaf checks on saved Linux images. Insertion and index dropping refuse explicitly. Actual casefold indexed writes, collision handling, and growth qualification are still required. |
| **6 — Prove recovery and enable qualified writes** | Test interrupted operations, journal recovery, errors, and refusals; enable only the combinations that pass. | Not yet reached. Keep casefold repair and unsupported feature combinations blocked. |
| **7 — Integrate and qualify Windows** | Audit the Windows adapter's name conversion, caching, create/rename semantics, serialization, device ownership, flushing, and eject. Test alternating Windows/Linux use. | Not yet reached. Pin and audit an actual `ext4-win-driver` revision; later qualify specific SteamOS versions/devices. |

## What comes next

1. Check current full CI and fresh Linux fixture results, then implement a bounded supported indexed insertion path behind the volume write gate. Direct routing probes and explicit fallback refusals are in place; complete write admission and collision/growth qualification remain.
2. Finish creation and mutation planning, including serialization from duplicate checks through commit, stale-entry handling, and replacement semantics.
3. Implement and independently verify indexed insertion, collisions, splits, and supported growth. Keep unsupported growth as a safe refusal; do not silently drop the index.
4. Exercise complete write sequences against Linux/e2fsprogs, including interrupted writes and recovery, before changing the write gate.
5. Integrate the qualified core into a pinned Windows build and test real cross-OS workflows. Core casefold support alone does not establish Windows or SteamOS readiness.

## Rules for continuing

- Work only on `casefold-rw`; do not change `main` or the sibling repositories.
- Keep casefold writes blocked until the supported operation and recovery matrix passes independent validation.
- Preserve original filename bytes. Never treat an unsupported lookup or corruption error as proof that a name is absent.
- Keep encryption, unknown encoding settings, unqualified directory shapes, malformed casefold names, generic casefold-flag changes, and casefold repair refused until separately qualified.
- Follow the repository's clean-room rules: published specifications, official Unicode data, and black-box Linux/e2fsprogs observations are allowed; kernel/e2fsprogs implementation source is not.
- This workspace has no local KVM. Use the existing CI harness for Linux/e2fsprogs checks; do not run the oracle tools or mount test images on the host.
- Check the actual branch, commit, working tree, and CI at the beginning of each session. Give brief plain-language notes in chat, complete one useful checkpoint, and pause before usage becomes excessive.
- Sol 6.1 can handle routine implementation and testing. Seek an additional Astra review for hashing/index design, concurrency and crash consistency, and the decision to enable writes.

## Instructions for a new chat

Treat this note as a handoff for ongoing implementation, not a request to restart the research or redo completed stages. The user authorizes useful implementation changes and checkpoint commits/pushes to `origin/casefold-rw`. Do not merge into or push to `main`. Do not change the sibling repositories. Keep explanations brief and understandable, and stop after a tested checkpoint rather than starting an open-ended run.

The next chat should first verify that this snapshot is still current. If later commits exist, inspect them and their CI results before choosing the next task; do not reset the branch to the commit recorded here. Preserve any uncommitted work. Read the applicable `AGENTS.md` and task instructions before editing.

### Workspace and commands

The current checkout is `/workspace/rust-fs-ext4`. Its origin is `https://github.com/Shinomorisama/rust-fs-ext4.git`. The sibling harness is pinned at `v0.4.0`, commit `7e0a84291c76fe4c762143f6f6d5787cc11749e7`.

Start with read-only state checks:

```sh
cd /workspace/rust-fs-ext4
git branch --show-current
git status --short
git log -5 --oneline
git rev-parse HEAD
git -C ../rust-fs-core status --short
git -C ../rust-fs-core describe --tags --exact-match
git -C ../fs-linux-test-harness status --short
git -C ../fs-linux-test-harness rev-parse HEAD
gh run list --branch casefold-rw --limit 5
```

The existing local toolchain uses:

```sh
export CARGO_HOME=/workspace/.cargo
export RUSTUP_HOME=/workspace/.rustup
export PATH=/workspace/bin:/workspace/.cargo/bin:$PATH
export CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=4
export CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/workspace/rust-fs-ext4/target/casefold-baseline
export XDG_CACHE_HOME=/workspace/.cache
export XDG_STATE_HOME=/workspace/.local/state
```

Use the repository's tasks, preserve command exit statuses, and inspect failure logs:

```sh
chore test:unit
chore lint
chore cli:install
```

Run them sequentially with failure handling; do not let a later successful command hide an earlier failure. Focused tests also run through `scripts/tier.sh` and `scripts/test.sh`. The full Linux/e2fsprogs/kernel suite runs in GitHub CI using the existing VM harness. GitHub CLI and HTTPS push worked in this workspace; reuse existing access before asking for credentials. A fresh environment may need the onboarding setup restored.

Before editing, preserve the baseline unit log. Afterward confirm all baseline tests still pass, counting repeated test names as a multiset rather than a set. Stage only intended files. Commit with the repository's conventional declarative subject and flat bullet body, then push with `git push origin HEAD:casefold-rw`. Check that CI starts for that exact commit. If it is still running at the pause point, report it as pending; do not claim it passed or spend an hour polling.

### Code map and completed behavior

- `src/superblock.rs` and `src/inode.rs`: validated encoding metadata and `directory_casefold_encoding`. Known encoding is UTF-8/Unicode 12.1; known flags are strict or non-strict. The volume feature alone does not make an ordinary directory case-insensitive.
- `src/casefold/unicode_12_1.rs` and `data/unicode/12.1.0/`: frozen Unicode engine and generated tables. `src/casefold/lookup.rs` contains `LookupName`, including fallible name preparation, comparison, duplicate detection, `hash_bytes()`, and the shared prepared-name `hash()` method.
- `src/casefold.rs`: legacy public `fold_name` and `casefold_name_hash` remain for API compatibility. Their newer Unicode dependencies and malformed-byte fallback must not govern filesystem casefold writes. Preserve public API compatibility while introducing the correct internal path.
- `src/path.rs`: casefold lookup validates supported directory/index structures, scans referenced leaves, and refuses duplicate equivalent entries. Literal `.` and `..` are handled separately. Unsupported depth, inline casefold directories, encryption, malformed casefold names, and normalized dot aliases remain refused. Supported indexed reads do not prove that insertion or split routing is safe.
- `src/fs.rs`: `lookup_entry_at` returns stored name bytes, inode, and recorded type. `find_dir_entry` supplies mutation preflight. `buffer_remove_matched_dir_entry` checks the stored spelling and expected inode against the current buffered transaction. Unlink, rmdir, and rename use it. This is not a general concurrency or inode-generation guarantee.
- Rename rereads its source parent through the transaction buffer after destination insertion/growth. Preserve that behavior: insertion can move the source entry or convert the parent layout. Existing same-inode hard-link/no-replace behavior must not be casually changed.
- Creation's shared planner rejects equivalent existing names. `build_directory_inode` now receives the parent, validates its policy, and inherits CASEFOLD before computing the inode checksum. Ordinary children, regular files, and symlinks do not acquire CASEFOLD merely because the volume supports it. This preparation is implemented behind the write gate; end-to-end casefold mkdir is not yet enabled.
- `src/htree.rs` now has internal `lookup_leaf_prepared`; `src/htree_mut.rs` has internal `plan_leaf_split_with_encoding`. Filesystem index routing and splitting call these prepared-policy paths. Public raw-name helper signatures and behavior remain compatible. The casefold guards in `src/fs.rs` still block actual indexed insertion and splitting. Indexed insertion now returns `Unsupported` rather than the `OutOfBounds` growth signal; `buffer_drop_htree_index` checks current buffered flags and refuses casefold before editing blocks. Collision/growth handling is not yet qualified for casefold.
- `src/features.rs` (`WRITE_BREAKING_INCOMPAT`) and mount/mutation checks in `src/fs.rs` keep casefold volumes write-protected. Preserve these protections during the next checkpoint.

### Completed index-routing checkpoint and bounded next task

The frozen hash foundation remains in place, with recorded debugfs vectors and unit checks for alias equality, signedness, split boundaries, preserved entry records, and refusal behavior. The new safety tests reproduced and then closed two fallback hazards: unqualified casefold insertion looked like a growth request, and the index-drop primitive could stage a casefold transformation. Both now refuse without changing the buffered transaction or device in the tested cases. The unit tier increased from 781 to 783 with no baseline losses.

Direct routing checks passed for **52 probes across eight saved Linux-created images**, covering 1 KiB/4 KiB blocks, strict/non-strict encoding, and root-only/one-intermediate-level indexes. The images' SHA-256 values matched their retained references. Probes include ASCII names, Café/canonical aliases, and long hard-link names at several positions in the larger directory. The checks verify index/leaf checksums and require the exact stored name and expected inode to occur in the hash-selected leaf; a full-directory lookup cannot satisfy that assertion.

These checks use independently specified comparison keys for the fixture's known ASCII/Café probes and the public raw-key router, which delegates to the prepared-name router. Frozen key production is separately verified by Unicode and recorded hash tests. This is sampled qualification for the fixtures' recorded default hash profile, not proof of arbitrary Unicode names, collision continuations, every hash-version/seed combination, or a complete writable index invariant.

The same selected-leaf assertions are committed in `tests/casefold_fixture_oracle.rs`, so fresh Linux fixture creation, cold kernel lookup, and non-repairing e2fsck run alongside them in CI. No kernel mount or e2fsprogs tool was run on the host. Fresh live CI results are pending at the push checkpoint; compile and saved-image checks passed locally.

Next, inspect the exact-commit full CI and Stage 0 evidence results. Then prepare supported in-place casefold indexed insertion behind the volume-wide write gate. Validate routing structures, target leaf, and uniqueness before staging changes. Preserve stored spelling and checksums. Continue refusing full-leaf growth, unqualified collision handling, and index dropping until their own implementations and Linux write/readback tests pass. A checksum-valid index and successful full-directory scan alone do not prove correct routing of every entry on a writable filesystem.

Pause after a useful tested checkpoint. Namespace serialization, complete collision/growth handling, crash recovery, and Windows integration remain later work. Review index-write admission and eventual write activation carefully; passing sampled routing tests does not authorize lifting a write gate.

### Conditions still required before enabling writes

Supported namespace operations must agree with Linux on stored names, inode identity, duplicates, link counts, directory inheritance, and rename outcomes. Creation and removal must remain correct across directory growth and moves between ordinary and casefold parents. Resolve serialization of the complete operation, from absence checks through commit, across Rust and C APIs.

Index tests must prove Linux can find entries after driver insertion, collisions, splits, and supported depth transitions, using cold mounts and non-repairing e2fsck checks. Unimplemented growth must refuse safely. A successful full-leaf scan by this driver is insufficient evidence of correct Linux index routing.

Crash/error tests must establish acceptable pre- or post-operation states, safe recovery in both directions, and correct checksums and allocation accounting. Audit mount, deferred replay, writability transitions, mutation APIs, and repair so relaxing one guard does not expose an unqualified path. Qualify journal/geometry combinations explicitly rather than assuming all ext4 features work.

Windows integration still needs a selected repository revision and an audit of its adapter and mount lifecycle. The user has no Steam hardware or known final filesystem profile. Do not require that information to continue independent core work, and do not claim SteamOS-device compatibility until tested. Ensure Unicode licensing accompanies future redistributed binaries/tables.

## Where the evidence lives

Committed documentation: `docs/CASEFOLD-BEHAVIOR.md`, `docs/CASEFOLD-STAGE0.md`, and `docs/CASEFOLD-STAGE1.md`. Reference observations live in `test-disks/casefold-*-reference.json`; Linux fixture tests and guest scripts live under `tests/`. The older stage documents describe earlier checkpoints and are not a current completion checklist.

The original detailed plan is `/workspace/casefold-implementation-plan.md`, outside the repository. Its baseline findings and future-tense descriptions are historical; use this note and verified code/CI state for current progress. In particular, do not infer a safe malformed-name fallback from that old plan: later observations led to the current refusal policy. This note contains the continuation essentials even if that original file is unavailable.

Some saved Linux images and local logs live under the checkout's ignored `tmp/` directory. They are useful when present but are not guaranteed in a fresh cloud environment; use committed tests and CI artifacts to reproduce or retrieve evidence. The earlier implementation CI passed; the frozen-hashing and current index-routing/refusal checkpoints require their own full CI results. No claim is made here that a separate coverage workflow ran at the latest commit.

This note is committed as `docs/extprogress.md` on `casefold-rw`. A new Codex session should open that branch, read this file, and verify the actual checkout and CI before continuing. Verify the selected commit against its own CI; earlier successful runs are evidence for those earlier checkpoints. Update this handoff as implementation checkpoints are completed.
