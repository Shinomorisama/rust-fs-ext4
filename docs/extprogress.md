# extprogress

## What we are doing

We are extending `rust-fs-ext4` so a normal ext4 removable-storage card can eventually be read and written safely from Windows through `ext4-win-driver`, then used natively by Linux and SteamOS. The intended use is a 1.5 TB microSD card shared between these systems.

The main compatibility gap is **ext4 casefold**: selected directories treat different spellings as the same name according to the filesystem's declared Unicode rules. Correct support must cover finding names, preventing equivalent duplicates, changing directory entries, maintaining directory indexes, and recovering interrupted writes. Stored filenames must retain their original bytes.

The goal is a working implementation. Documentation, unit tests, and independent Linux/e2fsprogs checks support that goal. Passing this driver's own tests alone is not enough to establish compatibility.

**Casefold writes are still deliberately blocked. This is not yet a Windows-ready release for the card.** No actual SteamOS hardware or Windows/card round trip has been qualified.

## Current checkpoint

- Repository: [Shinomorisama/rust-fs-ext4](https://github.com/Shinomorisama/rust-fs-ext4), branch `casefold-rw`.
- Latest implementation commit: `84706d5c9b8b03d03c9f3701ec8b378c2c4c9523`.
- Original baseline: `v0.8.0`, commit `204d8f6518ca5d66de07ab8e84c81501909b5d09`.
- Local validation: **776 unit tests pass; lint and CLI build pass**. All preceding baseline tests remain present and passing.
- [Latest full CI](https://github.com/Shinomorisama/rust-fs-ext4/actions/runs/38042898383): **passed**, verified when preparing this note. The preceding rename checkpoint's CI also passed.
- Working tree clean at verification; the checkpoint is pushed to the fork.
- `rust-fs-core` remains at `v0.3.0` (`9e900154a7dff2a6c8f136db31def33bed9f09cc`). Neither it nor `fs-linux-test-harness` is to be modified.

## Planned stages and our position

These retain the original plan's Stage 0–7 numbering. Completed foundations cover the qualified subset, not every possible ext4 combination.

| Stage | Work | Current position |
|---|---|---|
| **0 — Establish Linux reference behavior** | Build Linux-created images, record encoding/settings, measure uncertain behavior, and validate with Linux and e2fsprogs. | Established for the current test profiles; extend the matrix when new write behavior needs qualification. |
| **1 — Recognize and validate casefold policy** | Read filesystem encoding and directory flags; reject unknown or inconsistent settings. | Implemented. Write restrictions remain in place. |
| **2 — Implement frozen Unicode comparison** | Use filesystem-compatible Unicode 12.1 rules, including normalization and full case folding, rather than current platform Unicode tables. | Implemented for the supported valid-UTF-8 subset. Malformed casefold names and normalized dot aliases remain refused. |
| **3 — Resolve names and retain actual entries** | Share comparison rules across lookup and mutation planning; return stored spelling and inode identity. Validate indexed lookup. | Implemented for supported read shapes, including linear directories and indexes with one intermediate level. Casefold indexed reads scan validated referenced leaves; this does not establish correct write routing. |
| **4 — Implement namespace mutations** | Make create, mkdir, links, symlinks, unlink, rmdir, and rename obey casefold identity and inheritance. Preserve transaction safety. | **Current stage: partially implemented.** Removal and rename retain/recheck matched entries. Duplicate checks use shared comparison. New-directory inode construction now inherits casefold correctly. Actual casefold writes remain blocked. |
| **5 — Implement and qualify directory-index writes** | Use frozen Unicode keys for hashing, insertion, collisions, leaf splits, and growth. Preserve Linux-visible routing. | Still required. **Immediate next step: frozen-Unicode directory hashing**, a prerequisite shared with Stage 4. |
| **6 — Prove recovery and enable qualified writes** | Test interrupted operations, journal recovery, errors, and refusals; enable only the combinations that pass. | Not yet reached. Keep casefold repair and unsupported feature combinations blocked. |
| **7 — Integrate and qualify Windows** | Audit the Windows adapter's name conversion, caching, create/rename semantics, serialization, device ownership, flushing, and eject. Test alternating Windows/Linux use. | Not yet reached. Pin and audit an actual `ext4-win-driver` revision; later qualify specific SteamOS versions/devices. |

## What comes next

1. Connect directory hashing to the same frozen, fallible Unicode name policy used by lookup. Do not use the legacy public folding helper as the filesystem write policy.
2. Finish creation and mutation planning, including serialization from duplicate checks through commit, stale-entry handling, and replacement semantics.
3. Implement and independently verify indexed insertion, collisions, splits, and supported growth. Keep unsupported growth as a safe refusal; do not silently drop the index.
4. Exercise complete write sequences against Linux/e2fsprogs, including interrupted writes and recovery, before changing the write gate.
5. Integrate the qualified core into a pinned Windows build and test real cross-OS workflows. Core casefold support alone does not establish Windows or SteamOS readiness.

## Rules for continuing

- Work only on `casefold-rw`; do not change `main` or the sibling repositories.
- Keep casefold writes blocked until the supported operation and recovery matrix passes independent validation.
- Preserve original filename bytes. Never treat an unsupported lookup or corruption error as proof that a name is absent.
- Keep encryption, unknown encoding settings, unqualified directory shapes, malformed casefold names, generic casefold-flag changes, and casefold repair refused until separately qualified.
- Follow the repository's clean-room rules: published specifications, official Unicode data, and black-box Linux/e2fsprogs observations are allowed; kernel/e2fsprogs implementation source is not.
- This workspace has no local KVM. Use the existing CI harness for Linux/e2fsprogs checks; do not run the oracle tools or mount test images on the host.
- Check the actual branch, commit, working tree, and CI at the beginning of each session. Give brief plain-language notes in chat, complete one useful checkpoint, and pause before usage becomes excessive.
- Sol 6.1 can handle routine implementation and testing. Seek an additional Astra review for hashing/index design, concurrency and crash consistency, and the decision to enable writes.

## Instructions for a new chat

Treat this note as a handoff for ongoing implementation, not a request to restart the research or redo completed stages. The user authorizes useful implementation changes and checkpoint commits/pushes to `origin/casefold-rw`. Do not merge into or push to `main`. Do not change the sibling repositories. Keep explanations brief and understandable, and stop after a tested checkpoint rather than starting an open-ended run.

The next chat should first verify that this snapshot is still current. If later commits exist, inspect them and their CI results before choosing the next task; do not reset the branch to the commit recorded here. Preserve any uncommitted work. Read the applicable `AGENTS.md` and task instructions before editing.

### Workspace and commands

The current checkout is `/workspace/rust-fs-ext4`. Its origin is `https://github.com/Shinomorisama/rust-fs-ext4.git`. The sibling harness is pinned at `v0.4.0`, commit `7e0a84291c76fe4c762143f6f6d5787cc11749e7`.

Start with read-only state checks:

```sh
cd /workspace/rust-fs-ext4
git branch --show-current
git status --short
git log -5 --oneline
git rev-parse HEAD
git -C ../rust-fs-core status --short
git -C ../rust-fs-core describe --tags --exact-match
git -C ../fs-linux-test-harness status --short
git -C ../fs-linux-test-harness rev-parse HEAD
gh run list --branch casefold-rw --limit 5
```

The existing local toolchain uses:

```sh
export CARGO_HOME=/workspace/.cargo
export RUSTUP_HOME=/workspace/.rustup
export PATH=/workspace/bin:/workspace/.cargo/bin:$PATH
export CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=4
export CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/workspace/rust-fs-ext4/target/casefold-baseline
export XDG_CACHE_HOME=/workspace/.cache
export XDG_STATE_HOME=/workspace/.local/state
```

Use the repository's tasks, preserve command exit statuses, and inspect failure logs:

```sh
chore test:unit
chore lint
chore cli:install
```

Run them sequentially with failure handling; do not let a later successful command hide an earlier failure. Focused tests also run through `scripts/tier.sh` and `scripts/test.sh`. The full Linux/e2fsprogs/kernel suite runs in GitHub CI using the existing VM harness. GitHub CLI and HTTPS push worked in this workspace; reuse existing access before asking for credentials. A fresh environment may need the onboarding setup restored.

Before editing, preserve the baseline unit log. Afterward confirm all baseline tests still pass, counting repeated test names as a multiset rather than a set. Stage only intended files. Commit with the repository's conventional declarative subject and flat bullet body, then push with `git push origin HEAD:casefold-rw`. Check that CI starts for that exact commit. If it is still running at the pause point, report it as pending; do not claim it passed or spend an hour polling.

### Code map and completed behavior

- `src/superblock.rs` and `src/inode.rs`: validated encoding metadata and `directory_casefold_encoding`. Known encoding is UTF-8/Unicode 12.1; known flags are strict or non-strict. The volume feature alone does not make an ordinary directory case-insensitive.
- `src/casefold/unicode_12_1.rs` and `data/unicode/12.1.0/`: frozen Unicode engine and generated tables. `src/casefold/lookup.rs` contains `LookupName`, including fallible name preparation, comparison, duplicate detection, and `hash_bytes()`.
- `src/casefold.rs`: legacy public `fold_name` and `casefold_name_hash` remain for API compatibility. Their newer Unicode dependencies and malformed-byte fallback must not govern filesystem casefold writes. Preserve public API compatibility while introducing the correct internal path.
- `src/path.rs`: casefold lookup validates supported directory/index structures, scans referenced leaves, and refuses duplicate equivalent entries. Literal `.` and `..` are handled separately. Unsupported depth, inline casefold directories, encryption, malformed casefold names, and normalized dot aliases remain refused. Supported indexed reads do not prove that insertion or split routing is safe.
- `src/fs.rs`: `lookup_entry_at` returns stored name bytes, inode, and recorded type. `find_dir_entry` supplies mutation preflight. `buffer_remove_matched_dir_entry` checks the stored spelling and expected inode against the current buffered transaction. Unlink, rmdir, and rename use it. This is not a general concurrency or inode-generation guarantee.
- Rename rereads its source parent through the transaction buffer after destination insertion/growth. Preserve that behavior: insertion can move the source entry or convert the parent layout. Existing same-inode hard-link/no-replace behavior must not be casually changed.
- Creation's shared planner rejects equivalent existing names. `build_directory_inode` now receives the parent, validates its policy, and inherits CASEFOLD before computing the inode checksum. Ordinary children, regular files, and symlinks do not acquire CASEFOLD merely because the volume supports it. This preparation is implemented behind the write gate; end-to-end casefold mkdir is not yet enabled.
- `src/htree.rs`, `src/htree_mut.rs`, and indexed insertion/growth in `src/fs.rs`: the remaining hashing/routing work. Existing entries must use the same policy as new entries during splits. Do not enable the existing casefold-refused or index-drop fallback paths just to make a test pass.
- `src/features.rs` (`WRITE_BREAKING_INCOMPAT`) and mount/mutation checks in `src/fs.rs` keep casefold volumes write-protected. Preserve these protections during the next checkpoint.

### Bounded next task: frozen-Unicode directory hashing

Inspect the current hash call sites and connect a fallible, encoding-aware internal hash path to the established frozen name preparation. Preserve original entry bytes and ordinary-directory byte-sensitive behavior. Respect the effective hash version, signedness, filesystem seed, and existing reserved-hash rules. Equal comparison keys must hash equally, but equal hashes must never be treated as proof of equal names.

Use the existing Linux/e2fsprogs hash evidence and differential-test infrastructure to validate the new path; legacy helper tests alone do not demonstrate that the new path is exercised. Include Unicode aliases and refusal cases relevant to the frozen engine. Do not read prohibited implementation source to derive the algorithm.

Stop after a useful, tested hashing checkpoint with write gates intact. Full index insertion/growth, transaction serialization, crash recovery, and Windows integration are later work. If review shows that safe integration requires a larger design decision, explain that decision before expanding the task; Astra review is appropriate there.

### Conditions still required before enabling writes

Supported namespace operations must agree with Linux on stored names, inode identity, duplicates, link counts, directory inheritance, and rename outcomes. Creation and removal must remain correct across directory growth and moves between ordinary and casefold parents. Resolve serialization of the complete operation, from absence checks through commit, across Rust and C APIs.

Index tests must prove Linux can find entries after driver insertion, collisions, splits, and supported depth transitions, using cold mounts and non-repairing e2fsck checks. Unimplemented growth must refuse safely. A successful full-leaf scan by this driver is insufficient evidence of correct Linux index routing.

Crash/error tests must establish acceptable pre- or post-operation states, safe recovery in both directions, and correct checksums and allocation accounting. Audit mount, deferred replay, writability transitions, mutation APIs, and repair so relaxing one guard does not expose an unqualified path. Qualify journal/geometry combinations explicitly rather than assuming all ext4 features work.

Windows integration still needs a selected repository revision and an audit of its adapter and mount lifecycle. The user has no Steam hardware or known final filesystem profile. Do not require that information to continue independent core work, and do not claim SteamOS-device compatibility until tested. Ensure Unicode licensing accompanies future redistributed binaries/tables.

## Where the evidence lives

Committed documentation: `docs/CASEFOLD-BEHAVIOR.md`, `docs/CASEFOLD-STAGE0.md`, and `docs/CASEFOLD-STAGE1.md`. Reference observations live in `test-disks/casefold-*-reference.json`; Linux fixture tests and guest scripts live under `tests/`. The older stage documents describe earlier checkpoints and are not a current completion checklist.

The original detailed plan is `/workspace/casefold-implementation-plan.md`, outside the repository. Its baseline findings and future-tense descriptions are historical; use this note and verified code/CI state for current progress. In particular, do not infer a safe malformed-name fallback from that old plan: later observations led to the current refusal policy. This note contains the continuation essentials even if that original file is unavailable.

Some saved Linux images and local logs live under the checkout's ignored `tmp/` directory. They are useful when present but are not guaranteed in a fresh cloud environment; use committed tests and CI artifacts to reproduce or retrieve evidence. The current full CI passed, but no claim is made here that a separate coverage workflow ran at the latest commit.

This note is committed as `docs/extprogress.md` on `casefold-rw`. A new Codex session should open that branch, read this file, and verify the actual checkout and CI before continuing. The implementation commit above identifies the code checkpoint; later documentation-only commits do not change that validation result. Update this handoff as implementation checkpoints are completed.
